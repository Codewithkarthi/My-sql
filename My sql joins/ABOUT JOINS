=> MySQL Joining Tables
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Supported Types of Joins in MySQL:

=> INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
=> LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
=> RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
=> CROSS JOIN: Returns all records from both tables.
